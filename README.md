Artificial Intelligence using Reinforcement Learning Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 
What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The majority of the code for this project was provided.  What I needed to do was add the portion of the code that  given the accounted for the training 
of the neural network to account for loss, and how to train the agent through reinforcement learning.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
This class has provided a new prospective on AI and reinforcement Learning.  It has enhanced my understanding of what some deep learning algorithms are capable
of.  It has also shown me the variety of ways that the data can be utilized.  It has reinforced the need for ethical practices and their needs.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
The role of Computer scientists varies widely, they do a range of jobs to include writing software, testing software, software security, and data collection, 
to name a few. Computer Scientists not only keep things up and running, and improve it the products that are being used, but also to provide new 
technologies that can be put into use.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
The first thing I do is decide what the client needs, or what the end objective is.  Next, I would provide options for the customer, ensuring that those options
are legal and ethical. Depending on what solution is chosen, I would start creating the base of the software and then move on to specific functionality.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? 
My specific ethical responsibilities would be to protect the data of the individual users and the data of the company. To attempt to create programs and 
algorithms that are without basis. And to ensure that the company I am crating the software for is intending to use that data in a legal manor. I will not work 
for a company that would use others data illegally.
